# Minecraft Test Resource Pack

This is not intended for any serious use, but for me learning to set up resource packs.

I'm trying to keep it as "correct" as possible, while still learning, so go ahead and look for inspiration.

The pack is public mostly to see if release functionality can be used for hosting the pack to clients using a direct link from server config
